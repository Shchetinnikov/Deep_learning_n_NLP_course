# Homework â„–3 | Word embeddings
The following methods to get word embeddings are considered:

- Word2Vec Skip-gram
- Word2Vec CBOW
- FastText

For the program to work correctly, two files are required:
```
./data/spam_or_not_spam.csv
./data/SimLex-999.txt
```

When running the program in Colab, upload these files to the runtime environment. When starting the program in JupyterNotebook, write the relative path to these files in the corresponding lines of the program.

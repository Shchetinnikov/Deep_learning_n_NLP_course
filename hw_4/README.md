# Homework â„–4 | CNN and LSTM
Neural networks CNN and LSTM for text classification are considered.

For the program to work correctly, two files are required:
```
./data/Fake.csv
./data/True.txt
```
When running the program in Colab, upload these files to the runtime environment. When starting the program in JupyterNotebook, write the relative path to these files in the corresponding lines of the program.
